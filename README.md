# A* Pathfinding Algorithm Visualizer

This is an A* Pathfinding Visualizer, developed as part of my A-Level Computer Science Coursework. The project is built in Python, leveraging the Pygame library.

## Getting Started

Before using the program, ensure you have Python installed on your machine and install the Pygame library using the following command in your terminal:

pip install pygame



## How to use the program

- Left click to place walls on the grid.
- Use right click to place the start node (green) and end node (blue).
- Left click again on any object to delete it (or use the clear button to remove all objects).
- Use the pre-made maze button to look at an example of how the algorithm may solve a maze.

This project was created independently, but I referred to some online resources for guidance to better understand underlying concepts:
